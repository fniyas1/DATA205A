# DATA205 Capstone Project - Meteorite Landings

## Overview
This project analyzes global meteorite landings using data from Data.gov and Our World in Data. It investigates how meteorite discoveries have changed over time, the impact of technology on detection, and the geographic distribution of findings. Population density is also explored to understand human influence on reporting patterns.

## Goals
- Identify trends in meteorite findings over time.
- Explore the impact of technological advancements on detection.
- Visualize the geographic distribution of meteorite discoveries.
- Compare "Fell" vs. "Found" patterns.
- Examine the role of population density in reporting frequency.

## Repository Contents

- [`data/`](data/): Contains the cleaned datasets used for analysis.
- [`code/`](code/): R Markdown files for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and final analysis.
